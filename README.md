Alarm for Getting Up in the Morning

The purpose of this project is to make an alarm that wakes you up in the morning but must be shut off from a seperate stm board. This second STM board should be a fair bit away from the alarm so the person waking up must get out of bed to shut it off. This allows the person to get up in order to wake up which helps prevent falling back to sleep.
